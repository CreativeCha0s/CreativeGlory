Main Idea: A 2D platformer with random platforms pulled from a class and put into the game, kinda like the pipes in flappy bird. 
The user is able to jump, double jump, slide, and wall jump, depending on the obstacle they are facing.

Modes: The game will include an endless mode, where you keep running until you die. There is also a time trial mode where you beat a level as fast as possible.

Characters: There will be two characters. One that runs fast but doesnt have a double jump, while the other is slower but has a double jump.

Biomes: The game will include multiple biomes such as grass, canyon, volcano, and other potential biomes that are more unique
